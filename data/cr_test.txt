1	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
1	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
1	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
1	also , very light and portable .
0	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
1	it will read and play all cd audio disc .
1	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
0	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
0	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
0	on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
0	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
0	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
1	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
0	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
1	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
1	good quality video .
0	can't say whether i rec'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
1	it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
1	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
1	this is the third apex product i've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
1	the build quality feels solid , it doesn't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
1	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
1	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
1	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and haven't had any problems .
1	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
1	so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
1	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
1	works great !
1	silverish color really adds a special touch .
1	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
1	either way , can't go wrong with this price .
1	i am really impressed by this dvd player .
1	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
1	no matter the format .
1	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
1	the moveable lcd screen is great .
1	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
1	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
1	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
1	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
1	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
0	i've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
0	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
0	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
1	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
1	i've now had the camera for two months and i'm even more pleased with it .
1	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you're going to get at this price .
1	i've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
1	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
1	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
1	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
1	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i've seen .
0	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
1	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
1	definetely a great camera .
1	proven canon built quality and lens .
1	feels solid in hand .
1	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
1	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
1	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
1	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
1	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
0	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
0	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
0	you need the software to actually transfer files
0	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
0	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
1	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
1	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
1	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
1	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
1	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
1	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price wasn't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
1	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
1	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
1	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
1	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
1	price !
1	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
0	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
1	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
1	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
0	creative software stinks .
0	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i didn't notice after first day .
1	have had the player since xmass and love it !
1	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
0	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
1	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
1	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
1	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
1	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
1	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
1	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you don't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you're there .
1	the screen 's large and easily read .
0	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
1	sound : exceptional , though i can't really compare it to the ipod .
1	interface - practically seamless .
1	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
1	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
0	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
1	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
1	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
1	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
1	it was no problem for me to use their software .
1	overall , i'm giving this 5 stars as i've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
1	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
0	don't buy this player .
0	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "
0	don't buy this player .
0	do not buy this product - -
0	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
0	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
1	honestly , i love this player .
0	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
1	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
0	what a junk .
0	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
1	the sound quality is very good .
0	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
1	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
0	typically , the problem is the headphone jack - - it was for me and many others .
0	i'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
0	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
0	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
0	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
0	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
0	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
1	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they're still easy to use .
1	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
1	7 picture quality is excellent .
1	8 battery life is excellent .
1	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
1	10 great price for all the features .
0	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
0	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle - - wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
1	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
1	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i haven't played with it too much on manual .
1	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
1	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
1	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
1	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .
1	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
1	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
1	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
1	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
0	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
1	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
1	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
1	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
1	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
1	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
0	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile hasn't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
1	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
1	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
1	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
1	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
1	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
0	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
0	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
1	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
1	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
1	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
0	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
0	when talking the voice is not very clear .
1	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
1	it is crystal clear .
1	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
1	perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds .
1	i am impressed with this camera inside and out .
1	i love the camera .
1	this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .
1	the camera responce is very quick .
1	i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .
1	and the video quality is amazing .
1	and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
0	i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites .
0	there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .
0	the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark .
0	the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .
1	i was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detial .
1	this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attactive hi-tech casing .
1	very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .
1	the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .
1	the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .
1	this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .
1	after getting one for christmas from amazon , i'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .
1	i've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .
1	the size is tiny , which i love .
0	sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side , but i'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6.0 " adjust levels " function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though .
1	this camera is so easy to use !
1	all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .
1	the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .
1	i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .
1	i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to saythat i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .
1	you willdefinitly appreciate the small size .
1	well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !
1	the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome !
1	we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great .
1	we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6.00 for a year of bags - can't beat that ! !
1	we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .
1	this is really a nice diaper pail .
1	i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .
1	in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .
1	wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke .
1	i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .
1	1 . the diaper champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !
1	we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .
1	we don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail !
1	2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .
1	so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation !
1	the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .
1	3 . bags are easy to change .
0	yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone .
0	to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid .
1	works great ! ! ! !
1	5 . the price is right .
0	it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .
0	the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .
1	overall it is a great value .
1	for the price i don't think you can beat it .
1	this is a fantastic tool to use .
0	only problem is that is a bit heavy .
1	this is a quality product , not to be confused with teh cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .
0	they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .
0	my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
1	when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .
0	luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .
0	once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working .
0	you must keep double checking depths .
1	but , for the money it is a good machine .
0	well , my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years .
0	the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
1	for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .
1	for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .
0	if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !
1	i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod ' mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .
1	this unit comes with the usb / firewire cable as a standard item now .
1	i have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .
1	i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound .
0	this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .
1	i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .
0	the only problem is the battery life .
0	apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 !
1	the arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym .
1	i love the slim design ; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .
1	the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .
1	the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .
1	i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .
1	way to go apple !
1	i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that one ! " i was willing to shell out
1	absolutely no problems with this router .
1	i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .
1	a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .
1	speed is not a problem .
1	after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .
1	as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .
1	getting the router setup in a " vanilla " configuration that works for 99 % of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem .
1	second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .
1	i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speedboost router .
0	even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with " mac settings " , etc .
1	when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favour of wider coverage .
1	having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .
1	the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .
1	apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
1	the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .
0	we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .
0	it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .
0	the tech support is worthless too .
1	it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .
1	the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2,5 !
1	other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won't at lower ones , either .
0	the included headphones suck , so get your own .
1	transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
1	the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .
1	the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .
1	track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly catergorized into the zen .
1	rks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .
0	the touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .
0	just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two .
1	oh , and another is the cool " halo " light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .
0	but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i'm going to tell you what it is . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could've made it a potenial ipod killer .
1	one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .
1	two : it has a removeable / rechargeable battery , so you don't have to send the thing in when the re !
0	but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won't be able to hear anything .
0	because the " engineers " at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack .
0	again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .
0	again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !
0	the flaw is inside the zen .
0	the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
0	the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .
0	why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? ? ?
1	this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .
0	to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .
0	i haven't seen any problems yet , but if you don't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up .
0	this doesn't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .
0	the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 % or so .
0	again , this doesn't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .
1	otherwise , this is a great " alternative " mp3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .
1	i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .
1	i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .
1	the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .
1	it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .
1	further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .
1	i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i've owned .
1	however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the ' zen micro ' has to offer .
1	some features that the ' zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . actually an sd flash card drive . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .
1	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . the sound quality is excellent !
1	as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , ' creative mediasource organizer ' .
1	this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .
1	these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma lossless ; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .
1	by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .
0	i don't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .
0	now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .
1	when it 's working , it 's great but it is very tempermental .
1	the bottom line is " phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones " .
0	so , right out of the box i had issue .
0	namely , it wouldnt sync .
0	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .
0	but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .
1	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .
0	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .
1	it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .
1	speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !
1	putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
0	downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .
0	and the battery life is bad !
0	i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !
0	a bit dissapoitnd on that !
0	the gprs web access is sloooooooooooooow !
1	i got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet .
1	picture and video quality is ok .
1	love the speaker phone .
1	incredible memory !
1	aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !
1	picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .
1	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone .
0	you can't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .
0	t610 supports only midi files .
1	n6600 supports midi , wav , amr , mp3 etc .
1	it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !
1	i love this phone .
1	this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .
1	supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .
1	you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .
1	many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .
1	it uses the extendable mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .
1	its nice look is also a plus .
1	and also , since it is tri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .
1	i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years .
0	i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slooooooooow processor ) , and then i couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely !
0	it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( grrrrrr ! )
1	i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ez firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .
0	and i can't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !
1	i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .
0	it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .
0	i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open / close scanning that it does with every program .
0	is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ?
0	i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .
0	start up , log off , log on . everything became very slow .
0	configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .
0	multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect .
0	while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .
0	but it wouldn't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts .
0	i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn't let me do that either .
0	i tried it again this morning and it said i didn't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .
0	of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .
0	this time , it started the uninstallation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work .
0	i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .
1	their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .
0	the problems came from my video card .
1	the monitors were both good .
1	we are well pleased with the monitor and the company .
1	this machine is a replacement for your desktop .
1	solid , resistant to scratches , better heat dissipation .
1	the display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you'll forget entirely about workspace issues .
1	this machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be .
1	it 's so small , but big value mac .
1	highly recommend getting the superdrive and the wifi\/bluetooth modules .
1	apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .
1	the memory is not really hard to upgrade .
1	this is an excellent value .
1	not that apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for 3 years .
1	i have this connected to my late 2008 macbook pro , and it works flawlessly .
1	the sound is pretty good also ( although not anything like a 5.1 surround system ) there is reflection , but i only really notice it when the display is off , in which case you see you own reflection on the screen .
1	kudos apple - though your products are of superb quality , your support is equal to that .
1	this product is definitely worth the purchase .
0	their products are super expensive , especially to get them fixed .
1	however , you do get what you pay for in reliable products .
1	i don't for-see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if i do , i will know that with this product , it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps . the service of amazon in getting this item to me was faster than i expected and it is exactly what i knew it would be .
0	i hesitated for so long because of the price .
1	overall , it is an impressive display .
0	my only grips are the incompatibility with xp and the usb hub in the display .
0	the next day , i turned on my laptop and it connected to the network , but no internet connection .
1	this is a good product .
1	it has very good range - - much better than the linksys router it replaced .
1	it has a usb port - - so you can plug in a usb-powered drive and have network-accessible storage .
1	it seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .
1	good range & speed .
1	the price was the lowest i'd seen in my research ( best buy , office depot ) .
1	easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive .
1	also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link .
1	it came well-packaged .
1	it 's a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically .
1	i give it a rating of 5 stars for looks .
0	i don't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify ip addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static ip address , and assign a static ip address that is compatible with your router or modem .
0	setup software - for my application , i found the setup software on the enclosed cd to be useless .
1	technical support line - the buffalo technical support line on the other hand , was very helpful .
0	be prepared for a long wait ( 30-45 minutes ) , but the wait was worth it .
1	the technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support 4 stars .
0	if i only considered the software or internet user manual i would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 ( at best ) .
1	and it 's sleek and sexy looking as well .
1	update jan 12 , 2012 the device has worked flawlessly for the past year .
1	the device itself is pretty solid .
0	i only give it 4 stars because the device came with really old dd-wrt software .
1	the system was nowhere near stable , and the code was in " alpha " stage at best .
1	when i put it to use for my daughter 's graduation party in longer lengths , the speaker wire worked as expected , even out of doors .
1	if you want a quality product , delivered on time , buy this one .
1	tiny .
1	portable .
1	great sound .
1	the subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high !
1	pros : - great sound - sleek cool look - compact - comes with rca adapter - speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted cons : - mainly for pc only ( but works fairly well with tv 's ) - wattage isn't all that high - no immediate line in ( so you can't hook your mp3 player up and get srs right out of the box ) i've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers aren't long enough .
1	i'd venture to say that because of it 's low cost it 's the best pc stereo set out there costwise .
1	the audio cube is great .
1	the sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .
1	it works great for this purpose .
1	does what it should and the sound seems fine to me .
1	this setup worked perfectly the first shot at it .
1	i did not even have to hit the " auto tune " button , it just worked instantly .
1	if you want background music , better than your tv sound for movies , speakers around the house for parties , outside get togethers , this is about as good as you can expect , for the price .
1	works great !
1	easy to pair !
1	great sound !
1	good battery life !
1	life is good .
1	good price !
0	the controls are hard to see and not intuitive .
1	the sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like carnegie hall .
1	i absolutely love these speakers .
0	the sound quality is very poor .
1	: - ( all that being said , the speakers have good sound quality .
1	i am using them in my office , and they generally sound good .
0	however , since i am in an office , i normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .
1	once i turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good .
